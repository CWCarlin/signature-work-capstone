# Signature Work

### 1. Microbialite Database Website
https://github.com/CWCarlin/Microbialite-Website \
This website was developed as part of a semester-long group project for CISC 450 Database Design, in collaboration with Dr. Hickson, a geology professor at the University of St. Thomas. Dr. Hickson and his team had amassed a vast, unorganized collection of data on Microbialite formations in Nevada, which it was our task to normalize and structure. Our project involved not only organizing the data but also creating a user-friendly interface for researchers to access, add, and delete data from the database.

The website is designed to interact seamlessly with the Microbialite Database. It features a user interface built with JavaScript and employs Node.js to create an API that connects to an sqlite3 database. This allows users to efficiently view, input, and manage the data, enhancing the usability and functionality of the database for ongoing research.

### 2. C99 x86_64 Coroutines
https://github.com/CWCarlin/labyrinth \
Developed a cooperative multitasking API in raw C99 and x86_64 assembly. This API allows a programmer to utilize an async/await-esque interface; though it differs from JavaScripts async/await by also supporting use across multiple concurrent threads. This is part of a larger graphics/compute engine project I'm working on.


### 3. Fragment Shaders
https://github.com/CWCarlin/cg-fragmentshaders \
Created multiple postprocessing fragment shaders to change the visual appearance of a .mp4 file.
